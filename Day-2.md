- community support , IOC , learning curve => inversion of control

## _Library vs FrameWork:_

- Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
- A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn’t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
- The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how “opinionated” it is.

- The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.
